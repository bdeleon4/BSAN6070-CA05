# Project Title CA05: Logistic Regression

## Description
* In part A of this exercise we performed Logistic Regression on data retrieved from a study on Cardiovascular Disease and evaluated its performance. Our goal is to find the best logistic model to predict CVD risk of a single person. 
* In part B of this exercise we built our own Recommender System using a movies data set.

## Getting Started
* Google CoLab environment
* Data downloaded from https://github.com/ArinB/CA05-B-Logistic-Regression/raw/master/cvd_data.csv
                       https://github.com/ArinB/CA05-kNN/raw/master/movies_recommendation_data.csv
                       
* Path in Google Drive set to exactly /content/drive/My Drive/MSBA_Colab_2020/ML_Algorithms/CA05/Data

## Install the following packages:
* import pandas as pd
